The question should start with the word \"Question:\" and be a question which the *information* in the following passage might be an answer to. The passage should then be rephrased so that it makes sense as an answer to the question. You should start the rephrased answer with the word \"Answer:\" and then put the rephrased passage after it. Try to preserve the core information from the original passage while still rephrasing it to not just be the same words.\n\n<passage>\n**Example 1**\n\nPreparation of N-methyl 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine and of N,N-dimethyl 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine.\n\nAbout 600 g. of β-dimethylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride were converted to the corresponding free base by the action of 1.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide. The liberated free base was taken up in ether, the ether layer separated and dried, and the ether removed therefrom in vacuo. The residual oil comprising β-dimethylaminopropiophenone was dissolved in two liters of tetrahydrofuran, and the resulting solution added in dropwise fashion with stirring to a solution of four moles of diborane in four liters of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. An additional mole of diborane in one liter of tetrahydrofuran was added, and the reaction mixture stirred again overnight at room temperature. Next, two liters of aqueous hydrochloric acid were added to decompose any excess diborane present. The tetrahydrofuran was removed by evaporation. The acidic solution was extracted twice with one liter portions of benzene, and the benzene extracts were discarded. The acidic solution was then made basic with an excess of 5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide. The basic solution was extracted three times with two liter portions of benzene. The benzene extracts were separated and combined, and the combined extracts washed with a saturated aqueous sodium chloride and then dried. Evaporation of the solvent in vacuo yields 442 g. of N,N-dimethyl 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine.\n\nA solution containing 442 g. of N,N-dimethyl 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine in 5 l. of chloroform was saturated with dry gaseous hydrogen chloride. 400 ml. of thionyl chloride were then added to the chloroform solution at a rate sufficient to maintain reflux. The solution was refluxed an additional 5 hours. Evaporation of the chloroform and other volatile constituents in vacuo yielded N,N-dimethyl 3-phenyl-3-chloropropylamine hydrochloride which was collected by filtration, and the filter cake washed twice with 1500 ml. portions of acetone. The washed crystals weighed about 500 g. and melted at 181°–3° C. with decomposition. An additional 30 g. of compound were obtained from the acetone wash by standard crystallization procedures. The structure of the above compound was verified by NMR and titration.\n</passage>\n\nYou should put both the question and its answer between rephrase tags."

      "content": "<rephrase>\nQuestion: How is N,N-dimethyl 3-phenyl-3-chloropropylamine hydrochloride synthesized from β-dimethylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride?\n\nAnswer: The synthesis begins by converting β-dimethylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride into its free base. This free base is then reduced using diborane in tetrahydrofuran, which transforms the ketone group into an alcohol, resulting in N,N-dimethyl 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine. This alcohol is then converted to the final hydrochloride salt by first treating the compound with hydrogen chloride in chloroform, followed by a reaction with thionyl chloride to replace the hydroxyl group with a chlorine atom. After removing the volatile solvents, the final product, N,N-dimethyl 3-phenyl-3-chloropropylamine hydrochloride, is obtained as a crystalline solid, and its structure is confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and titration.\n</rephrase>"
