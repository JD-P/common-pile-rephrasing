Avoid words longer than 5-7 letters while preserving as much of the meaning as you can. Put the rephrased passage in <rephrase> tags <rephrase>like this</rephrase> so that it can be automatically extracted by an inference script.\n\n<passage>\nIn general, the form and the structure of the brains of quadrupeds are almost the same as those of the brain of man; the same shape, the same arrangement everywhere, with this essential difference, that of all the animals man is the one whose brain is largest, and, in proportion to its mass, more convoluted than the brain of any other animal; then come the monkey, the beaver, the elephant, the dog, the fox, the cat. These animals are most like man, for among them, too, one notes the same progressive analogy in relation to the corpus callosum in which Lancisi—anticipating the late M. de la Peyronie20—established the seat of the soul. The latter, however, illustrated the theory by innumerable experiments. Next after all the quadrupeds, birds have the largest brains. Fish have large heads, but these are void of sense, like the heads of many men. Fish have no corpus callosum, and very little brain, while insects entirely lack brain.\n\nI shall not launch out into any more detail about the varieties of nature, nor into conjectures concerning them, for there is an infinite number of both, as any one can see by reading no further than the treatises of Willis “De Cerebro” and “De Anima Brutorum.”\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it B1 intermediate reading level. Include all the information available in the original passage and go sentence by sentence."

      "content": "<rephrase>\nIn general, the shape and build of the brains of four-legged animals are almost the same as the human brain. They have the same shape and layout all over. But a key difference is that humans have the largest brain, and for its size, it has more folds than any other animal. After humans, come monkeys, beavers, elephants, dogs, foxes, and cats.\n\nThese animals are most like humans. Among them, we see a similar step-by-step change in the corpus callosum. Lancisi thought this part was where the soul is, and he came before M. de la Peyronie, who also said this. De la Peyronie, however, showed this idea with many tests.\n\nAfter all four-legged animals, birds have the biggest brains.\n\nFish have large heads, but they lack sense, just like the heads of many people. Fish have no corpus callosum and very little brain. Insects have no brain at all.\n\nI will not go into more detail about the many kinds in nature, or guesses about them, because there are too many to count. Anyone can see this by reading the books by Willis called \"De Cerebro\" and \"De Anima Brutorum\".\n</rephrase>"
