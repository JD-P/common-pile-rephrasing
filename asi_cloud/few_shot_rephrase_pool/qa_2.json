The question should start with the word \"Question:\" and be a question which the *information* in the following passage might be an answer to. The passage should then be rephrased so that it makes sense as an answer to the question. You should start the rephrased answer with the word \"Answer:\" and then put the rephrased passage after it. Try to preserve the core information from the original passage while still rephrasing it to not just be the same words.\n\n<passage>\n3\nEach of the twenty equal spherical equilateral triangles which form the “faces” of this construction is modularly divided along its edges. Lines connecting these modularly divided edges in a three-way great circle grid provide the outline for the plan of construction. I have found that if the structural members be aligned with the lines of the grids, the resulting framework will be characterized by more uniform stressing of the individual members than is possible with any construction heretofore known. The structural members may be aligned with all lines of the three-way grid, or just with selected ones of those lines. If the members are arcuate, or spherical, they will coincide with the grid lines; if they are straight, or flat, they will be chords of the great circles which are the grid lines.\n\nA further general aspect of my preferred construction which may be noted here is that there is a “six-ness” throughout the pattern of structural elements on each face of the spherical icosahedron except that at each vertex, where five faces join at the center of an icosacap, there is a “five-ness.” In the case of a skeletal framework made up of struts in a pattern of equilateral triangles, this “six-ness” is manifested by the fact that there are six such triangles around every vertex except at the vertices of the icosacaps where the “five-ness” is manifested by the fact that there are only five such triangles around those vertices. Similarly, in the case of a continuous framework made up of diamond-shaped sheets, we find a “five-ness” only at the vertices of the icosacaps where five sheets toe in to the one point. This aspect of five-ness and six-ness will be described more in detail further on, and need be mentioned only in general terms here so as to lay a foundation for the description of various specific frameworks built according to the invention.\n</passage>\n\nYou should put both the question and its answer between rephrase tags."

      "content": "<rephrase>\nQuestion: How does the structural framework of a spherical icosahedron achieve more uniform stress distribution?\n\nAnswer: The framework is constructed by dividing each of the twenty spherical triangles of the icosahedron in a modular way. The construction plan is based on a three-way grid of great circles that connect these divisions. Aligning the structural members with this grid, either using all lines or a selection of them, results in a framework with more uniformly stressed members than previous designs. The members can be arcuate, following the great circle lines directly, or straight, forming chords of those circles. A notable pattern in this design is the recurring \"six-ness\" on the faces, where six structural triangles or diamond sheets meet at most vertices. The exception is at the vertices of the icosacaps, where only five elements join, creating a \"five-ness.\" This pattern contributes to the structural properties of the framework.\n</rephrase>"
