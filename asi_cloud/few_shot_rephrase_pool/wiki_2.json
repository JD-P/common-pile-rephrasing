Your rewrite should try to preserve as much of the original information as possible while rephrasing and transforming the style. If the passage is of a literary or abstract nature then do your best to interpret it in a factual and objective way.\n\n<passage>\nI had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society. When visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers there was but the third chair for them all, but they generally economized the room by standing up. It is surprising how many great men and women a small house will contain. I have had twenty-five or thirty souls, with their bodies, at once under my roof, and yet we often parted without being aware that we had come very near to one another. Many of our houses, both public and private, with their almost innumerable apartments, their huge halls and their cellars for the storage of wines and other munitions of peace, appear to me extravagantly large for their inhabitants. They are so vast and magnificent that the latter seem to be only vermin which infest them. I am surprised when the herald blows his summons before some Tremont or Astor or Middlesex House, to see come creeping out over the piazza for all inhabitants a ridiculous mouse, which soon again slinks into some hole in the pavement.\n\nOne inconvenience I sometimes experienced in so small a house, the difficulty of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we began to utter the big thoughts in big words. You want room for your thoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course or two before they make their port. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course before it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may plough out again through the side of his head. Also, our sentences wanted room to unfold and form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations, must have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across the pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so near that we could not begin to hear,—we could not speak low enough to be heard; as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each other’s undulations. If we are merely loquacious and loud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near together, cheek by jowl, and feel each other’s breath; but if we speak reservedly and thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above, being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other’s voice in any case. Referred to this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of hearing; but there are many fine things which we cannot say if we have to shout. As the conversation began to assume a loftier and grander tone, we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till they touched the wall in opposite corners, and then commonly there was not room enough.\n</passage>\n\nBe sure to put your answer in rephrase tags similar to the passage tags above."

    "content": "<rephrase>\nThe author maintained a small house containing only three chairs, which he described as serving distinct purposes: one for solitude, two for friendship, and three for society. When more than three visitors arrived, they would typically stand, and it was noted that a surprisingly large number of people could be accommodated in the limited space. Observers have recorded gatherings of twenty-five to thirty individuals in the dwelling, yet the proximity did not necessarily foster a sense of close personal interaction.\n\nThe author expressed a critical view of conventionally large houses, both public and private, describing them as \"extravagantly large for their inhabitants.\" He compared the residents of such grand estates, like Tremont or Astor House, to \"vermin\" or a \"ridiculous mouse\" emerging from and retreating into a vast structure, suggesting the architecture dwarfed and dehumanized them.\n\nA noted inconvenience of the small house was the lack of sufficient physical distance for meaningful conversation. The author argued that significant thoughts require space to be properly formulated and communicated, likening a thought to a bullet that must stabilize in flight to be effective. He proposed that individuals, like nations, require \"suitable broad and natural boundaries\" or a \"neutral ground\" between them for thoughtful discourse.\n\nTo illustrate this principle, the author cited the ideal distance for conversation as being across a pond, whereas in his confined house, occupants were too close to speak quietly without interference, comparing it to two stones thrown in water so near that their ripples disrupt one another. It was posited that loud, trivial talk allows for close proximity, but reserved and thoughtful speech requires greater distance, allowing \"animal heat and moisture\" to dissipate. For the most profound, unspoken connection, physical separation to the point of being out of earshot was considered necessary. Consequently, as discussions became more lofty, the chairs would be pushed further apart, often until they touched opposite walls, at which point the room's limitations became apparent.\n</rephrase>"
