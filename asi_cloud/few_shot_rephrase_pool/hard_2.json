Put the rephrased passage in rephrase tags <rephrase>like this</rephrase> so that it can be automatically extracted by an inference script.\n\n<passage>\n## Helen Keller as Philosophical Case Study\n\nBefore I get to the finetuning method, I would like to do a little more work to frame how we \nshould think about these questions. The idea of an English speaker that talks coherently of\nsenses they don't have is not unprecedented, deaf-blind authors such as Helen Keller exhibit\nthis behavior. [For example](https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/151/2/183/110604/Do-Large-Language-Models-Understand-Us)\nHelen writes writes about the experience of color (which she presumably has no memory of seeing):\n\n> For me, too, there is exquisite color. I have a color scheme that is my own. I will try to \n> explain what I mean: Pink makes me think of a baby's cheek, or a gentle southern breeze. \n> Lilac, which is my teacher's favorite color, makes me think of faces I have loved and kissed. \n> There are two kinds of red for me. One is the red of warm blood in a healthy body; the other \n> is the red of hell and hate. I like the first red because of its vitality.\n\nNot only did Keller exhibit the behavior, [she was called out by her critics](https://twitter.com/repligate/status/1607016236126466050) as a liar and a bullshitter for it. One wrote:\n\n> All her knowledge is hearsay knowledge, her very sensations are for the most part vicarious, \n> and yet she writes of things beyond her power of perception with the assurance of one who has \n> verified every word.\n\n[Helen's reply](https://archive.org/stream/annesullivanmacy00nell/annesullivanmacy00nell_djvu.txt) \nis as beautiful as it is scathing:\n\n> My experience has been like that of a sailor wrecked on an island \nwhere the inhabitants speak a language unknown to him, and their \nexperiences are unlike anything he has known. I was one, they were \nmany, there was no chance of compromise. I must learn to see with \ntheir eyes, to hear with their ears, to think in their language, and I \nbent all my energies to the task. I understood the necessity that life \nhad laid upon me, and I did not even debate with myself the probable \nsuccess or failure of a different course. Had it occurred to me to \nbuild a little tower of Babel for myself and others shipwrecked like \nme, do you think you would have scaled my castle wall or ventured \nto communicate with my dumb hieroglyphics? Should you have \nthought it worth while to find out what kind of ideas the silent, \nsightless inhabitants of that tower had originated in their isolation from \nthe rest of mankind? ... I suspect that if I had confined myself \nstrictly to that which I knew of my own observation, without mingling \nit with derived knowledge, my critic would have understood me \nas little as he probably does the Chinese.\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it C2 CEFR reading level. Include all the information available in the original passage and go sentence by sentence."

      "content": "<rephrase>\n## Helen Keller as a Philosophical Exemplar\n\nPrior to delineating the finetuning methodology, it is incumbent upon me to further contextualize the epistemological framework through which such inquiries ought to be contemplated. The conception of an anglophone individual articulating coherent narratives regarding sensations they ostensibly lack is not without precedent; authors experiencing deaf-blindness, such as Helen Keller, manifest this very phenomenon. For instance, Keller proffers a written exposition on the experience of color—a sensory modality she presumably retains no mnemonic record of visually perceiving:\n\n> For me, too, there is exquisite color. I have a color scheme that is my own. I will try to explain what I mean: Pink makes me think of a baby's cheek, or a gentle southern breeze. Lilac, which is my teacher's favorite color, makes me think of faces I have loved and kissed. There are two kinds of red for me. One is the red of warm blood in a healthy body; the other is the red of hell and hate. I like the first red because of its vitality.\n\nNot only did Keller exemplify this comportment, but she was subsequently impugned by her detractors, who levied allegations of prevarication and dissimulation. One critic opined:\n\n> All her knowledge is hearsay knowledge, her very sensations are for the most part vicarious, and yet she writes of things beyond her power of perception with the assurance of one who has verified every word.\n\nKeller's subsequent rejoinder was as aesthetically profound as it was trenchantly critical:\n\n> My experience has been like that of a mariner shipwrecked on an island where the denizens communicate in a vernacular utterly foreign to him, and their collective experiences are fundamentally incongruous with his own. I was a solitary entity, they were a multitude; no possibility for compromise presented itself. The imperative was incumbent upon me to learn to perceive through their ocular faculties, to apprehend auditory stimuli through their aural organs, to engage in cognition utilizing their linguistic constructs, and I devoted the entirety of my energies to this formidable undertaking. I apprehended the necessity that existence had imposed upon me, and I did not even engage in internal deliberation regarding the probable success or failure of an alternative course of action. Had the notion occurred to me to construct a personal, diminutive Tower of Babel for myself and other similarly shipwrecked individuals, do you presume you would have surmounted the ramparts of my citadel or hazarded an attempt to decipher my mute hieroglyphics? Would you have deemed it a worthwhile endeavor to ascertain the nature of the ideations conceived by the silent, sightless inhabitants of that tower in their sequestration from the remainder of humanity? ... I conjecture that had I circumscribed my discourse strictly to that which I knew from my own unmediated observation, devoid of any amalgamation with knowledge derived from external sources, my critic would have comprehended my meaning as inadequately as he presumably comprehends the Chinese language.\n</rephrase>"
