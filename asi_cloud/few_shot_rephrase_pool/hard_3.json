Put the rephrased passage in rephrase tags <rephrase>like this</rephrase> so that it can be automatically extracted by an inference script.\n\n<passage>\n_The Madman._--Have you ever heard of the madman who on a bright\nmorning lighted a lantern and ran to the market-place calling out\nunceasingly: \"I seek God! I seek God!\"--As there were many people\nstanding about who did not believe in God, he caused a great deal\nof amusement. Why! is he lost? said one. Has he strayed away like a\nchild? said another. Or does he keep himself hidden? Is he afraid of\nus? Has he taken a sea-voyage? Has he emigrated?--the people cried out\nlaughingly, all in a hubbub. The insane man jumped into their midst\nand transfixed them with his glances. \"Where is God gone?\" he called\nout. \"I mean to tell you! _We have killed him,_--you and I! We are all\nhis murderers! But how have we done it? How were we able to drink up\nthe sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon? What\ndid we do when we loosened this earth from its sun? Whither does it\nnow move? Whither do we move? Away from all suns? Do we not dash on\nunceasingly? Back-wards, sideways, forewards, in all directions? Is\nthere still an above and below? Do we not stray, as through infinite\nnothingness? Does not empty space breathe upon us? Has it not become\ncolder? Does not night come on continually, darker and darker? Shall\nwe not have to light lanterns in the morning? Do we not hear the noise\nof the grave-diggers who are burying God? Do we not smell the divine\nputrefaction?--for even Gods putrefy! God is dead! God remains dead!\nAnd we have killed him! How shall we console ourselves, the most\nmurderous of all murderers? The holiest and the mightiest that the\nworld has hitherto possessed, has bled to death under our knife,--who\nwill wipe the blood from us? With what water could we cleanse\nourselves? What lustrums, what sacred games shall we have to devise? Is\nnot the magnitude of this deed too great for us? Shall we not ourselves\nhave to become Gods, merely to seem worthy of it? There never was a\ngreater event,--and on account of it, all who are born after us belong\nto a higher history than any history hitherto!\"--Here the madman was\nsilent and looked again at his hearers; they also were silent and\nlooked at him in surprise. At last he threw his lantern on the ground,\nso that it broke in pieces and was extinguished. \"I come too early,\"\nhe then said, \"I am not yet at the right time. This prodigious event\nis still on its way, and is travelling,--it has not yet reached men's\nears. Lightning and thunder need time, the light of the stars needs\ntime, deeds need time, even after they are done, to be seen and heard.\nThis deed is as yet further from them than the furthest star,--_and yet\nthey have done it!\"--It_ is further stated that the madman made his way\ninto different churches on the same day, and there intoned his _Requiem\næternam deo._ When led out and called to account, he always gave the\nreply: \"What are these churches now, if they are not the tombs and\nmonuments of God?\"--\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it C2 CEFR reading level.

      "content": "<rephrase>\n_The Deranged Individual._--Have you ever been apprised of the lunatic who, on a morning of resplendent luminosity, ignited a lantern and proceeded with celerity to the public agora, vociferating without intermission: \"I am in pursuit of God! I am in pursuit of God!\"--Given that a multitude of persons congregated there were devoid of belief in a deity, he occasioned considerable diversion. \"What! has he become misplaced?\" inquired one. \"Has he wandered astray in the manner of an infant?\" proffered another. \"Or does he clandestinely sequester himself? Is he apprehensive of our presence? Has he embarked upon a maritime expedition? Has he expatriated himself?\"--the assemblage exclaimed with derisive hilarity, creating a tumultuous cacophony. The unhinged man propelled himself into their nucleus and transfixed them with his penetrating gaze. \"Whither has God absconded?\" he proclaimed. \"I intend to elucidate for you! *We have perpetrated his assassination,*—you and I! We are collectively his slayers! But through what methodology have we accomplished this? How did we possess the capacity to imbibe the entirety of the ocean? Who furnished us with the sponge to expunge the entire horizon? What actions did we undertake when we disengaged this terrestrial sphere from its solar anchor? To what destination does it now progress? To what destination do we ourselves advance? Away from every solar body? Do we not perpetually hurtle forth? In retrograde, lateral, and forward trajectories, in every conceivable vector? Does the dichotomy of above and below retain any validity? Do we not meander, as if through a boundless ontological void? Does not the vacuity of space exert its exhalation upon us? Has the ambient temperature not undergone a palpable diminution? Does nocturnal darkness not approach incessantly, with escalating profundity? Shall we not be compelled to ignite lanterns diurnally? Do we not perceive the auditory phenomena generated by the funerary excavators who are interring God? Do we not olfactorily detect the divine decomposition?—for even celestial entities undergo putrefaction! God is deceased! God persists in a state of death! And we are responsible for his homicide! By what means shall we administer consolation to ourselves, the most egregious of all assassins? The most sacrosanct and potent entity that the cosmos has hitherto harbored has exsanguinated beneath our scalpel—who shall efface the sanguinary evidence from our persons? With what aqueous substance could we possibly achieve purification? What propitiatory rites, what hallowed competitions must we necessarily conceptualize? Is not the sheer magnitude of this transgression excessively formidable for us to reconcile? Shall we not be obligated to undergo a metaphysical apotheosis, merely to appear commensurate with the deed's gravity? A more monumental occurrence has never previously transpired—and consequently, all individuals postdating our existence pertain to a historical echelon superior to any antecedent chronicle!\"—At this juncture, the deranged individual became silent and directed his scrutiny once more upon his auditors; they, too, maintained a silence and regarded him with stupefaction. Ultimately, he cast his lantern upon the terrestrial surface, resulting in its fragmentation and subsequent extinguishment. \"My advent is precipitous,\" he subsequently declared, \"I have not yet arrived at the opportune moment. This momentous occurrence remains in transit, journeying—it has not yet penetrated the auditory faculties of humanity. Atmospheric electrical discharges and resultant thunderclaps necessitate a temporal interval, the luminescence of astral bodies requires duration for propagation, and significant actions demand time, even subsequent to their commission, to be perceived and comprehended. This particular deed remains more remote from their cognizance than the most distant star—*and yet they have consummated it!\"*—A supplementary account indicates that the madman subsequently gained ingress into a multiplicity of ecclesiastical structures on that identical day, and therein intoned his *Requiem æternam deo.* Upon being extracted and subjected to interrogation, he invariably provided the rebuttal: \"What ontological or functional significance do these churches now retain, if they do not constitute the sepulchers and commemorative edifices of God?\"--\n</rephrase>"
