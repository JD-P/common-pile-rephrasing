Your rewrite should try to preserve as much of the original information as possible while rephrasing and transforming the style. If the passage is of a literary or abstract nature then do your best to interpret it in a factual and objective way.\n\n<passage>\n“No, sir, it is clemency. You are my prisoners of war. I keep you, when I could, by a word, plunge you into the depths of the ocean. You attacked me. You came to surprise a secret which no man in the world must penetrate,—the secret of my whole existence. And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more? Never! In retaining you, it is not you whom I guard—it is myself.”\n\nThese words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander, against which no arguments would prevail.\n\n“So, sir,” I rejoined, “you give us simply the choice between life and death?”\n\n“Simply.”\n\n“My friends,” said I, “to a question thus put, there is nothing to answer. But no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel.”\n\n“None, sir,” answered the Unknown.\n\nThen, in a gentler tone, he continued—\n\n“Now, permit me to finish what I have to say to you. I know you, M. Aronnax. You and your companions will not, perhaps, have so much to complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate. You will find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you have published on ‘the depths of the sea.’ I have often read it. You have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you. But you do not know all—you have not seen all. Let me tell you then, Professor, that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel. You are going to visit the land of marvels.”\n\nThese words of the commander had a great effect upon me. I cannot deny it. My weak point was touched; and I forgot, for a moment, that the contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of liberty. Besides, I trusted to the future to decide this grave question. So I contented myself with saying—\n\n“By what name ought I to address you?”\n\n“Sir,” replied the commander, “I am nothing to you but Captain Nemo; and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the Nautilus.”\n</passage>\n\nBe sure to put your answer in rephrase tags similar to the passage tags above."

    "content": "<rephrase>\nCaptain Nemo, the commander of the submarine *Nautilus*, informed Professor Pierre Aronnax and his companions that they were to be held as prisoners of war. He stated that their attack on his vessel and their attempt to discover his secrets, which he was determined to keep from the world, justified this action. Nemo explicitly rejected the possibility of releasing them, asserting that their imprisonment was essential for the preservation of his own anonymity and existence.\n\nWhen Aronnax questioned whether this constituted a choice between life and death, Nemo confirmed it. The professor noted that no formal agreement bound them to the commander. In response, Nemo adopted a more conciliatory tone, addressing Aronnax directly. He revealed his familiarity with the professor's published work on marine biology and suggested that their confinement would provide an opportunity to extend his studies beyond the current limits of terrestrial science. Nemo promised they would witness unparalleled marvels, a prospect that significantly impacted Aronnax, momentarily overshadowing his concerns about liberty.\n\nConcluding the interaction, Aronnax asked how to address him, to which the commander replied that he was to be known only as Captain Nemo, and that they were merely passengers of the *Nautilus*.\n</rephrase>"
