I wanted to push on; but the manager looked\ngrave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it\nwould be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we\nwere till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning to\napproach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in\ndaylight—not at dusk or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight\nmiles meant nearly three hours’ steaming for us, and I could also see\nsuspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was\nannoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too,\nsince one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we\nhad plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the\nmiddle of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides\nlike a railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the\nsun had set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility\nsat on the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and\nevery living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into\nstone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not\nsleep—it seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest\nsound of any kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to\nsuspect yourself of being deaf—then the night came suddenly, and struck\nyou blind as well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped,\nand the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When\nthe sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more\nblinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there,\nstanding all round you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps,\nit lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering\nmultitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing\nlittle ball of the sun hanging over it—all perfectly still—and then the\nwhite shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased\ngrooves. I ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be\npaid out again. Before it stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry,\na very loud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque\nair. It ceased. A complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords,\nfilled our ears. The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under\nmy cap. I don’t know how it struck the others: to me it seemed as\nthough the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from\nall sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It\nculminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive\nshrieking, which stopped short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of\nsilly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling\nand excessive silence. ‘Good God! What is the meaning—’ stammered at my\nelbow one of the pilgrims—a little fat man, with sandy hair and red\nwhiskers, who wore sidespring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his\nsocks. Two others remained open-mouthed a whole minute, then dashed\ninto the little cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting\nscared glances, with Winchesters at ‘ready’ in their hands. What we\ncould see was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as\nthough she had been on the point of dissolving, and a misty strip of\nwater, perhaps two feet broad, around her—and that was all. The rest of\nthe world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just\nnowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a\nshadow behind.\n</passage>\n\nYou should put both the question and its answer between rephrase tags."

      "content": "<rephrase>\nQuestion: Why did the steamer delay its approach to Kurtz's station and what ominous event occurred during the wait?\n\nAnswer: As evening fell on the second day, we were about eight miles from Kurtz's station. I wanted to continue, but the manager insisted it was too dangerous to navigate the treacherous river in the dark and that we should wait for daylight, a sensible suggestion given that the journey would take nearly three hours. Despite my intense and somewhat irrational annoyance at the delay, we anchored in the middle of the narrow, straight reach. The jungle on the banks was unnaturally still and silent, a condition that felt more like a trance than sleep. The night and the following morning's solid, blinding fog were profoundly disorienting. Just as the fog briefly lifted around nine o'clock, revealing the immense, silent jungle, it closed in again. I had just ordered the chain to be let back out when a loud cry of infinite desolation broke the silence. This was followed by a tumultuous, shrieking uproar that seemed to come from the mist itself, leaving us frozen in fear. The pilgrims with me were terrified, one stammering in shock while others grabbed their rifles. The world beyond our barely-visible steamer and a tiny strip of water had completely vanished, making the source of the sounds both unknown and terrifying.\n</rephrase>"
