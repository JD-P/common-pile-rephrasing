Life and death\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\n\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.\n\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\nnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\nwell remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\nhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\nare equally neglected.”\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it B1 intermediate reading level.

      "content": "<rephrase>\nNo one can imagine the many feelings that pushed me forward, like a storm, in the first joy of success. Life and death seemed to me like perfect limits that I would break through, and I would send a flood of light into our dark world. A new kind of being would thank me as its maker and start; many happy and good beings would live because of me. No father could ask for the thanks of his child as much as I would earn theirs. As I thought about this, I felt that if I could give life to dead things, I might in time (even though it seemed impossible now) bring back life where death had made the body rot.\n\nThese thoughts kept me going, as I worked on my task with constant drive. My face grew pale from too much study, and my body became very thin from being stuck inside. Sometimes, just when I was almost sure, I failed; but I still held on to hope that the next day or hour might make it real. A secret only I knew was the hope I had given myself to; and the moon watched me work late at night, while with never-ending and breathless eagerness, I tried to find nature's hidden spots. Who can think of the horrors of my secret work as I touched the wet and unholy damp of the grave or hurt living animals to give life to dead clay? My arms and legs shake now, and my eyes swim when I remember; but then a strong and almost crazy urge pushed me on; I seemed to have lost all feeling but for this one goal. It was really just a short daze, that only made me feel more sharply as soon as the false push stopped, and I went back to my old ways. I collected bones from places of the dead and disturbed, with rude hands, the great secrets of the human body. In a lone room, or rather a cell, at the top of the house, and cut off from all other rooms by a hall and stairs, I kept my workshop of dirty creation; my eyes were popping out as I worked on the small parts of my job. The cutting room and the kill house gave me many of my items; and often my human self turned with disgust from my work, while, still pushed by an eagerness that always grew, I brought my work close to an end.\n\nThe summer months passed while I was thus busy, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a very lovely season; never did the fields give a more full harvest or the vines produce more grapes, but my eyes were blind to the beauty of nature. And the same feelings that made me ignore the world around me also made me forget those friends who were so far away, and whom I had not seen for so long. I knew my not writing upset them, and I well recalled my father's words: \"I know that while you are happy with yourself you will think of us with love, and we will hear from you often. You must forgive me if I take any break in your letters as a sign that your other tasks are also ignored.\"\n</rephrase>"
