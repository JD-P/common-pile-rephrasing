Put the rephrased passage in rephrase tags <rephrase>like this</rephrase> so that it can be automatically extracted by an inference script.\n\n<passage>\nI'd be a hypocrite if I didn't bother to look at what others have already written about doing a literature review. This talk with Dr. Candace Hastings (Hastings, 2009) on doing literature review is decent, it spends a lot of time focusing on the way to use sources in your writing once you've found them. She also explains how you can use citation counts to find the most important scholars in the field you're looking at. Guidelines for writing a literature review by Helen Mongan-Rallis (Mongan-Rallis, 2018) is a well written page on this topic for academics.\n\nEvery time I do research I perform a simple thought experiment: assuming somewhere in the world exists evidence that would prove or disprove my hypothesis, where is it? I tend to visualize this as a shot of earth from space, and then 'zooming in' on the sense data that would show me what I want to know. The literalism of this visualization is important because it emphasizes the sensory basis of evidence. Things happen in the world, and artifacts of their presence are left over afterwards. Physical remnants, images captured by cameras and sketch artists, written observations. This 'object level' phenomenological universe is what you're trying to get information about by looking at the literature.\n\nA key consequence of this is that 'the literature' is not always what's output by academics. If I was studying martial arts, I would be looking into the history of martial arts as it's practiced by martial artists, in whatever mediums they use to record and disseminate information. Memory is a human activity, and your first priority should be to find the most effective and relevant sources for whatever you're looking at.\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it C2 CEFR reading level. Include all the information available in the original passage and go sentence by sentence."

      "content": "<rephrase>\nIt would constitute a profound manifestation of intellectual dishonesty were I to neglect a conscientious examination of extant scholarly discourse pertaining to the methodology of literature reviews. This didactic colloquy with Dr. Candace Hastings (Hastings, 2009) on the subject represents a reasonably substantive exposition, devoting considerable attention to the methodological application of sources within one's composition subsequent to their procurement. Furthermore, she elucidates the utilitarian function of citation metrics as a mechanism for identifying preeminent scholars within a given disciplinary field. The compendium of guidelines authored by Helen Mongan-Rallis (Mongan-Rallis, 2018) constitutes a meticulously articulated and erudite treatise on this subject matter, tailored for an academic readership.\n\nConcomitantly with each investigative endeavor I undertake, I habitually engage in a rudimentary cognitive exercise: presupposing that probative evidence which could either corroborate or refute my central thesis exists somewhere on the planet, what would be its precise locus? I am inclined to conceptualize this through a mental visualization commencing with a planetary vista, subsequently transitioning to a process of 'progressively focusing' upon the specific sensory data that would yield the desired epistemic insight. The deliberate literalism inherent in this visualization is paramount, as it serves to underscore the fundamentally sensorial substrate of all empirical evidence. Phenomena manifest within the material world, and tangible vestiges of their occurrence persist thereafter. These encompass physical remnants, visual representations captured through photographic or artistic means, and documented observations. It is this 'object-level' phenomenological reality from which one endeavors to extract information through a meticulous perusal of the literature.\n\nA pivotal corollary arising from this epistemological stance is that 'the literature' is not invariably circumscribed to the formalized output of the academy. Were my research to focus on martial arts, for instance, my inquiry would extend to the historical trajectory of the discipline as enacted and perpetuated by its practitioners, utilizing whatever mediums they have employed for the purposes of mnemonic transmission and informational dissemination. Commemoration and recollection are intrinsically human activities, and one's primary investigative imperative must invariably be the identification of the most efficacious and pertinent sources, irrespective of their conventional academic provenance.\n</rephrase>"
