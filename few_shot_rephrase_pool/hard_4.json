Put the rephrased passage in rephrase tags <rephrase>like this</rephrase> so that it can be automatically extracted by an inference script.\n\n<passage>\nMy first introduction to custom games was from browsing youtube videos about Halo 2’s online multiplayer. One I remember particularly well was a comedic take on the popular ‘Infection’ game type variant of slayer, where instead of caring about points at all the game ran on honor rules. Everybody except one person was on the red or blue team. The one person is on the green team, making them the ‘zombie’. Their job is to go around with an energy sword killing other players to convert them into ‘zombies’. There was no actual enforcement mechanism for this, players killed by a zombie would need to change teams manually. Anybody killed by a zombie has to change to the green team. The game ends once everybody has switched teams to green. This was one of many such variants that ran on honor rules such as ‘Lava Man’, and one of even more variants that were popular but not necessarily honor rule reliant like ‘Tower of Power’.\n\nIn Halo 2 custom games were limited to changing aspects of the gametype. (Ruleset) The core map would be largely the same in terms of scenery, placement of objects such as crates, etc. The major changes that could be made to the environment through game types were the removal of weapons and grenades. One major addition in Halo 3 was the introduction of Forge, which let you edit maps to tailor them towards a specific gametype. We’ll cover Forge in more detail later, but if you’re completely unfamiliar with the subject this video (The discussion of forge starts about four minutes in.) should be illustrative.\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it C2 CEFR reading level. Include all the information available in the original passage and go sentence by sentence."

      "content": "<rephrase>\nMy inaugural encounter with bespoke gaming modalities originated from perusing digital video compendiums concerning Halo 2's online multiplayer functionalities. One particular instance remains conspicuously indelible in my recollection: a ludicrous reinterpretation of the prevalent 'Infection' variant, itself a derivation of the foundational Slayer paradigm, which operated not on any codified scoring mechanism but rather on a system predicated entirely upon a gentlemen's agreement and the players' proprietary adherence to an honor code. The entire cohort, with a singular exception, was allocated to either the crimson or azure faction. This lone individual was consigned to the viridescent team, thereby anointing them the 'zombie'. Their designated objective was to traverse the arena, equipped with an energy blade, to exterminate other participants and thereby assimilate them into the burgeoning undead legion. The framework precluded any automated enforcement mechanism; consequently, players vanquished by a zombie were obligated to manually re-designate their team affiliation. Any individual succumbing to a zombie was mandated to defect to the viridescent collective. The ludic session would culminate in a terminal state upon the universal transmigration of all participants to the green faction. This constituted merely one exemplar among a multitude of analogous variants governed by such honor-based protocols, such as 'Lava Man', and was itself a subset of an even more extensive taxonomy of popular variants, not all of which were necessarily reliant on such informal stipulations, a prominent example being 'Tower of Power'.\n\nWithin the architectural confines of Halo 2, the customization of games was circumscribed to the alteration of specific gametype parameters, or the foundational ruleset. The core cartographical environment remained largely immutable with respect to its topographical scenery and the placement of environmental objects, such as crates. The most consequential environmental modifications attainable through gametype manipulation were the selective eradication of weapon and grenade spawn points. A monumental augmentation introduced in the subsequent Halo 3 iteration was the deployment of the 'Forge' utility, a cartographical customization interface which empowered users to directly edit the virtual topography, thereby tailoring the environment to a specific gametype's exigencies. We shall undertake a more exhaustive examination of the Forge apparatus at a subsequent juncture; however, for an individual wholly unacquainted with the subject matter, the visual guide referenced herein—the pertinent discourse commences approximately four minutes into the presentation—should prove profoundly didactically illustrative.\n</rephrase>"
