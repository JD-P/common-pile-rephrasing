A new order of accuracy has become possible with the introduction of artificial earth-satellite navigation systems wherein the instantaneous location of the satellites is precisely known.\n\nPrior earth-satellite navigation systems have, in general, either included the measurement of range rate (doppler frequency shift) of cw transmissions by the satellite or measured range by measuring the time interval between interrogation and response by a transponder on the satellite. It has been found that range is the better parameter to use. Unfortunately, the measurement of range has heretofore required the navigator to radiate an interrogation signal (and thereby betray his presence) and also raises the possibility that the satellite transponder will saturate from a plurality of simultaneous interrogations by different navigators.\n\n**SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION**\n\nThe present invention provides the advantages of the prior earth-satellite navigation systems while avoiding their disadvantages. More specifically, the present invention allows the navigator to passively determine his position by measuring the distance, or range, to one or more satellites. Each satellite transmits multifrequency signals which are derived from extremely precise oscillators. Similar multifrequency signals are derived by the navigator’s equipment from an extremely precise oscillator which is phase synchronized with the oscillators on the satellites. By measuring the phase differences between the signals received from the satellites and the locally produced reference signals, the navigator obtains an indication of the distance to the satellites and, therefrom, of his own location. The navigator’s presence is not betrayed since no interrogation signal transmission is required.\n\n**OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION**\n\nIt is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide an improved earth-satellite navigation system.\n\nA further object is to provide an improved earth-satellite navigation system wherein range is measured without the necessity of transmitting an interrogatory signal.\n\nYet another object is the provision of an improved earth-satellite navigation system wherein range is measured without the necessity of transmitting an interrogatory signal by comparison of the phase of signals received from the satellites and locally generated reference signals.\n</passage>"

This system employs a passive ranging technique, which allows a navigator to calculate their position without transmitting any signals, thereby maintaining operational secrecy.\n\n**Background**\n\nHistorically, celestial navigation provided the most accurate means of terrestrial navigation. The advent of artificial satellite systems enabled a significant improvement in potential accuracy. Early satellite navigation systems typically operated by one of two methods: measuring the range rate through the Doppler frequency shift of a continuous wave transmission from the satellite, or measuring range by sending an interrogation signal to a transponder on the satellite and timing the response.\n\nWhile range was identified as a superior parameter for navigation, its measurement in these early systems had significant drawbacks. The requirement for the user to actively transmit an interrogation signal could reveal the user's location. Furthermore, the satellite's transponder could become saturated if too many users attempted to interrogate it simultaneously, leading to system failure.\n\n**Technical Method**\n\nThis navigation system operates by having each satellite transmit multifrequency signals generated by highly precise onboard oscillators. The user's receiver is equipped with a similarly precise oscillator that is phase-synchronized with the satellites' oscillators. The system passively measures the distance, or range, to a satellite by comparing the phase of the signals received from the satellite with the phase of reference signals generated locally. The calculated phase difference provides a measure of the signal's time of flight, which is directly related to the distance between the user and the satellite. By performing this measurement for multiple satellites, the user's precise location can be triangulated.\n\n**Key Features and Advantages**\n\nThe primary innovation of this system is its passive operation. Because the user only receives signals and does not transmit, their presence is not betrayed. This eliminates the risk of satellite transponder saturation from multiple users and allows for covert navigation. The system's accuracy is derived from the use of highly stable, synchronized oscillators on both the satellites and the user's receiver, and the direct measurement of range through phase comparison.\n\n</rephrase>"
