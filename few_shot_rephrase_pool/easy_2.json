Avoid words longer than 5-7 letters while preserving as much of the meaning as you can. Put the rephrased passage in <rephrase> tags <rephrase>like this</rephrase> so that it can be automatically extracted by an inference script.\n\n<passage>\nUSER [A: ECONOMIST], The devices are nowhere near as cheap as they could be. It's basically just a niche product right now. When I bought mine I think it was number 7000-something? Like the product has existed for several years and they've shipped under 10k units in that time. You look up videos about OpenBCI from 2016(?) and the founder clearly expected to find a killer application once they got the devices out there. But so far nobody seems to have found a use for it compelling enough to spur more investment and bring the price down.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: TINKER], Their new Galea headset is interesting in that instead of going for higher bandwidth they go for multimodal and ergonomics. They even reduce the number of EEG sensors from 16 in their Cyton + Daisy device back down to 8. Considering the expensive part of the setup is the microvoltmeter(?) for the electronic circuits and electronics have advanced a lot since the last cortex device shipped it's clear they don't think the bottleneck is more sensors/bandwidth.\n\nUSER [A: JUDGE], They explain this decision in one of the talks they gave to hype Galea. Which is that they noticed users of OpenBCI were pairing it up with eye tracking VR headsets anyway, so they figured why not team up with a VR company to explicitly ship a headset jam packed with sensors. The reasoning seems to be that if you ship a multimodal enough device someone will come up with a use for it that justifies the large price tag.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPIRICISM], What stands out to me is that the studies where they recover mental speech and imagery from EEG use high bandwidth EEG for it, 128-256 electrodes. This implies that the product you need to ship in order to start getting the killer apps is a cheaper higher bandwith EEG with ergonomic dry electrodes. 64 sensors seems feasible?\n\nUSER [A: RATIONAL], Don't be too hasty about the bandwidth requirements. I remember looking up the literature on this once and seeing a finding that the sensor requirements were smaller than you'd think owing to the high sampling rate.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: TRAINER], It could be 16 sensors or 256. The important point is that people are coming at this from the wrong angle. They're thinking about applications, correlations, small data. The goal shouldn't be to correlate the EEG signal to anything, but to figure out what kind of signal EEG even is. If you had a decent autoencoder you could finetune it on downstream tasks and maybe start to actually get somewhere.\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it B1 intermediate reading level.

The product has been out for a few years, and they have sold less than 10,000 units in that time. If you watch videos from 2016 about OpenBCI, the founder thought they would find a very useful app after the devices were sold. But until now, no one has found a use that is good enough to get more money and make the price lower.\n\nTheir new Galea headset is cool because it does not aim for more data speed, but for many types of sensors and comfort. They even cut the number of EEG sensors from 16 in their old device to 8. Since the costly part is the tool that measures small electric signals for the circuits, and tech has improved a lot since the last device, it shows they do not think the problem is more sensors or data speed.\n\nThey told why they did this in a talk to promote Galea. They saw that users were using OpenBCI with VR headsets that track eyes, so they thought to work with a VR firm to make a headset full of sensors. The idea is that if you make a device with many sensors, someone will find a use for it that makes the high price okay.\n\nI see that studies which get mind speech and pictures from EEG use high data speed EEG with 128 to 256 sensors. This means the product we need is a cheaper, high data speed EEG with comfy dry sensors. Maybe 64 sensors could work?\n\nDo not rush to think we need high data speed. I recall reading that the number of sensors needed is less than you might think because of the fast sampling.\n\nIt might be 16 sensors or 256. The key point is that people are looking at this the wrong way. They think about uses, links, and small data. The aim should not be to link the EEG signal to things, but to learn what the EEG signal is. If you had a good autoencoder, you could adjust it for other jobs and maybe make progress.\n</rephrase>"
