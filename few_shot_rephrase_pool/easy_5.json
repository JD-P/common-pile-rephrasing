Avoid words longer than 5-7 letters while preserving as much of the meaning as you can. Put the rephrased passage in <rephrase> tags <rephrase>like this</rephrase> so that it can be automatically extracted by an inference script.\n\n<passage>\n6\nUser B may readily perform his decoding transformations since d_B and n_B are part of his decoding key and e_A and n_A are readily available on the public file.\n\nIn any of the above operations, the underlying messages may be initially encoded using conventional encryption techniques, and the subsequently decoded messages may be decoded using a corresponding decryption technique. The present invention may be used with any length messages provided that the message is broken into suitable length blocks before encoding. For example, very long messages may readily be broken into blocks, with each block labelled with a “this is block t of R” notation and transmitted after signing each block separately. Any word to be transformed, using either the encoding or decoding key for a terminal, must be broken into blocks, wherein each block is representative of a number in the range 0 to n-1 for the corresponding terminal. Following transmission over the channel and the second transformation, the resultant words may readily be “unblocked”.\n\nThe present invention provides a public key system for establishing private communications and also for providing private communications with the signature. A characteristic of this system is that the public revelation of the encryption key does not reveal the corresponding decryption key. As a result, couriers or other secure means are not required to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only the intended recipient can decipher the message since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. Furthermore, the message can be “signed” by deciphering it with the privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify the signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key corresponding to the originator. Signatures cannot be forged and the signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature.\n\nIn other forms, the present invention may be utilized with both the encoding and decoding keys secret. In such forms, if users A and B wish to communicate privately over an insecure channel, they may use the channel to transmit E_A and E_B to B and A, respectively. Then when A wishes to send B a message M, he first produces E_B(M) = C and sends this to B. B applies D_B to C to obtain M. An eavesdropper on the channel will have access to E_B, E_A and C but without access to D_B is unable to decode C.\n\nIn alternative forms, the present invention may be utilized with the encoding and decoding devices coupled by a data path to a memory so that encoded only, or encoded signed, data words may be stored in the memory, thereby ensuring file integrity. In such an embodiment, the data path and memory are considered to be a communications channel coupling the encoding and decoding devices (which devices may be at the same physical location). In addition, the present system is suitable for use in access control systems.\n</passage>\n\nTry to preserve as much of the original meaning and information as possible during your rephrase while making it B1 intermediate reading level. Include all the information available in the original passage and go sentence by sentence."

      "content": "<rephrase>User B can easily do his decoding because d_B and n_B are part of his key, and e_A and n_A are easy to get from a public list.\n\nIn all these steps, the first messages can be coded using normal coding ways, and then the coded messages can be decoded using a matching decoding way. This new method can work with messages of any size, but the message must be split into small parts before coding. For example, very long messages can easily be split into parts. Each part is marked with a note like \"this is part t of R\" and sent after signing each part on its own. Any word that needs to be changed, using the coding or decoding key for a device, must be split into parts. Each part stands for a number from 0 to n-1 for that device. After sending over the path and the second change, the resulting words can easily be put back together.\n\nThis new system gives a public key way to set up private talks and also to give private talks with a sign. A key point of this system is that if the coding key is made public, it does not show the matching decoding key. So, there is no need for messengers or other safe ways to send keys, because a message can be coded using a coding key that the person who should get it has made public. Only the person who should get the message can decode it because only he knows the matching decoding key. Also, the message can be \"signed\" by decoding it with the private decoding key that is kept secret. Anyone can check the sign using the matching public coding key from the person who sent it. Signs cannot be faked, and the signer cannot later say that his sign is not real.\n\nIn other ways, this new method can be used with both the coding and decoding keys kept secret. In such cases, if user A and user B want to talk in private over a not-safe path, they can use the path to send E_A to B and E_B to A. Then when A wants to send a message M to B, he first makes E_B(M) = C and sends this to B. B uses D_B on C to get M. A person listening on the path will have E_B, E_A, and C, but without D_B, they cannot decode C.\n\nIn other ways, this new method can be used with coding and decoding devices connected by a data path to a memory. This way, only coded or coded and signed data words can be stored in the memory, which makes sure the files are safe and correct. In this setup, the data path and memory are seen as a talk path connecting the coding and decoding devices (these devices might be in the same place). Also, this system is good for use in systems that control who can get in.</rephrase>"
